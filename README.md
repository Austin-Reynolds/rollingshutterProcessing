# rollingshutterProcessing
A Processing sketch designed to illustrate the rolling shutter effect.

Written very quickly as a response to Matt Parker's video regarding Destin Sandlin's video regarding
rolling shutter.

To run/tinker with this sketch simply download the latest version of Processing from processing.org (it's free, but feel free to donate)
and open the sketch. The speed of rotation is controlled by the global "period" variable.

I have also included a video of the sketch running if you'd rather not download Processing.
